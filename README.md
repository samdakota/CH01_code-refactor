## Requirements
The assignment required the following acceptance criteria:

    GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code

    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the icon and image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Visuals
